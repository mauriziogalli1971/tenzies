# Tenzies

Another dice game written with React.

## Overview

Tenzies is a simple and fun dice game implemented using React. 
The objective is to roll dice until all dice show the same value, with the ability to "hold" dice to lock their values between rolls. 
I have approached this project to learn fundamental React concepts such as state management and component structure.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay: Roll dice and hold specific dice to strategize your win
- Dynamic UI built entirely with React
- Clean, modern design
- Easy to understand and play
